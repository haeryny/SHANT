    "- *Iteration*  - Repitition of a Process <br>\n",
    "- *`For Loop`* - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated <br>\n",
    "- *`While Loop`*  - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met <br>\n",
    "- *Initialization* - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. <br>\n",
    "- *Condition* - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.\n",
    "- *increment/decrement* - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.\n",
    "- *Indexing* / *List Index* - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 <br>\n",
    "- *`append`*, *`remove`*, *`pop`* - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. <br>\n",

    "- *Nesting* - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. <br>\n",

    "## Lists\n",
    "For list operations, write expressions that use list indexing and list procedures. For algorithms involving elements of a list, write iteration statements to traverse a list.\n",
    "- List procedures are implemented in accordance with the syntax rules of the programming language. \n",
    "- Iteration statements can be used to traverse a list\n",
    "- Knowldege of exisiting algorithms that use iteration can help in constructing new algorithms. Some are:\n",
    "    - Determining a minimum or maximum value in a list\n",
    "    - Computing a sum or average of a list of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Lists?\n",
    "- Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable\n",
    "- Each sequence is demarcated with an <mark>index</mark>, starting from 0. This is known as <mark>base 0 indexing</mark>\n",
    "- In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order\n",
    "- Lists can also be called arrays\n",
    "- Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list.\n",

    "##### Uses of Nested lists\n",
    "Placing lists within lists allows you to have arrays of similar data together, and create complexity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some uses include: \n",
    "- Creating 2d Arrays \n",
    "- Storing similar, but slightly different categories (sublists)\n",
    "- Create a matrix\n",
