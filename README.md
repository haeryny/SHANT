# Artist Profile Website

This project is an artist profile website that allows users to search for artists by genre and view their profiles. It provides a list of artists with their respective genres, along with an option to add them to favorites.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help users discover new artists based on their preferred genre. It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface where users can search for artists in a specific genre and explore their profiles. Additionally, users can add their favorite artists to a favorites list for future reference.

## Functionality

The website consists of two main components:

1. Artist Genre Finder: This component allows users to enter a desired genre and retrieve a list of artists belonging to that genre. The list is dynamically generated based on the user's input and displays the names of the artists in alphabetical order. If no artists are found in the desired genre, a corresponding message is displayed.

2. Artist Profiles: The website provides a collection of artist profiles in the form of cards. Each card includes the artist's name, genre, an image, and a button to learn more about the artist. Clicking the "Learn More" button opens a new page with detailed information about the artist. Additionally, each card includes a button to add the artist to the user's favorites list.

## Code Explanation

The code for this project is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief explanation of the code structure:

- The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the website, including the layout, search input field, artist list container, and artist profile cards.

- The CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styles and layout properties for various elements of the website, such as the background color, card styles, and button styles.

- The JavaScript code (`script.js`) handles the functionality of the website. It includes an array of artists with their names and genres, a function to sort and filter the artists based on the user's input, and functions to dynamically update the artist list and favorites list.

The code uses event listeners to detect user actions, such as clicking the "Find Artists" button or adding an artist to favorites. It manipulates the DOM to display the filtered artist list and update the favorites list accordingly.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, you can simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure to have a working internet connection as the images and artist details are fetched from external sources.
